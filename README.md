# Intro
Beginner data analyst and eventual data scientist undergoing a career change from education. I graduated with a Material Science degree and use my habits gained from studying a rigorous field to my current work and use my intellect, passion and enthusiasm for data analytics to learn what I need from scratch!

Part of my self learning is learning sql, R, Tableau and Python. I've extensively used MS Excel, Word and PowerPoint throughout college and am very accustomed to said software. I learned a great deal of exploratory SQL during my Covid Project and learned how to clean data with SQL during my Personal Finance Project. Tableau is a very fun software infrastructure to create engaging narratives that are highly interactable. I'm learning the art of R in terms of writing statistical code, but my familiarity with statistics lessens the learning curve immensely. I'm a beginner python programmer and am learning to data mine information to augment data collection methodology.

Outside of technical skills I enjoy jazz, hikes and the occaisonal Muay Thai bout. Fun fact, I'm both an indoor and outdoor person! I love shooting my .22 and flying model planes outside and have a leisure read inside with baroque music in the background. I have an infectous laugh that'll get people having fun very quickly when it's time, and am a very serious person when a job demands such.
